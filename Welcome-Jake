## The Work of Improving Lives

At Gore, everyone matters.

Since 1958, Gore has offered our Associates a different kind of workplace based on freedom, fairness, and making things work. Our lattice structure encourages initiative, communication, and personal growth. Instead of job titles, we have commitments. As a result, our Associates take great pride and ownership in their individual contributions as well as the company's success.

Gore Medical employs more than 4,000 Associates, with roles ranging from experienced medical professionals and engineers to communication and administrative commitments. Each member of our Medical Products Division ultimately contributes to our global mission of providing creative therapeutic solutions to complex medical problems.
